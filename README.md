> Designing scalable, performant and high fault tolerance system that scales to handle high(m's) load. 

**Motivation**  
Aim to discuss system and software design patterns and implement DevOps friendly example scenario following proposed principles. 

### Principles of Distributed System Design 
_not in particular order_
 * High-availability
 * Performance
 * Scalability
 * Manageability
 * Reliability
 * Cost

**TODO:** _summary_
 
 
# Components
 * DNS
 * CDN
 * LoadBalancers
   - L4 (Transport)
   - L7 (Application)
 * WebServers
 * RDBMS
 * NOSQL
 * Message Queues
 * Caching

## Example Scenario Suggestions
* Realtime Backend as a Service
* E-Commerce
* Messaging service for online gaming
* etc

## Example scenario
E-Commerce
============================
Sample application is cross-platform either at the server and client side and the architecture proposes a simplified microservice oriented architecture implementation with multiple autonomous microservices (each one owning its own data/db and of course we will be discussing pros/cons later on) and implementing different approaches within each microservice using different programming languages (I have no time/plan to evaluate them in deep currently)
